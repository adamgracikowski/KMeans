# K-Means Clustering:

This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm using three different approaches: 
- CPU-based computation, 
- GPU computation using custom CUDA kernels, 
- and GPU computation utilizing the Thrust library. 

The goal is to compare the performance and efficiency of these methods in clustering large datasets.

The project was implemented as a part of the Graphic Processors in Computational Applications course at Warsaw University of Technology during the winter semester of the 2024-2025 academic year.
